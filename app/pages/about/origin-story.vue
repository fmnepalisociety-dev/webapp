      <h2>Our Story: Origin of Nepali Society of Fargo-Moorhead</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
      <p>
        Many students and professionals of Nepali origin have been settling in Fargo, North Dakota; Moorhead, Minnesota;
        and the surrounding areas for years. Institutions such as North Dakota State University and Minnesota State
        University, Moorhead, welcome students from Nepal annually. As new professionals and entrepreneurs establish
        their careers and businesses, our community continues to grow. Children born in the U.S. or who immigrated at a
        young age are now navigating both Nepali and American cultures, proudly calling Fargo-Moorhead their home.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dashain and Tihar are cherished festivals that bring our Nepali community together, filling our homes with joy,
        blessings, and vibrant traditions. The joyful spirit of Deusi-Bhailo during Tihar in 2025 enlivened our
        gatherings with music and laughter, as friends and families came together to sing and dance.
      </p>

      <p>
        On December 7, 2025, the Deusi-Bhailo team and the broader Nepali community from Fargo (North Dakota) and
        Moorhead (Minnesota) convened a potluck to formally establish the Nepali Society of Fargo-Moorhead and elect its
        inaugural executive committee, with the objective of fostering unity and broader engagement. We extend our
        sincere gratitude and profound appreciation to the members of our community whose vision and initiative made the
        founding of the Nepali Society of Fargo-Moorhead possible, marking the beginning of our shared journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        As we move forward, we welcome suggestions and feedback to help our society flourish and strengthen our bonds
        within the broader community.
      </p>
